• Labour:
  - All productive human effort, both physical and mental
  - Can be paid or unpaid
  - The value of a worker is their human capital
  - Labourers receive wages
  - Includes both skilled and unskilled workers

• Capital:
  - All man-made resources used to produce goods/services
  - Includes machinery, buildings, tools, equipment
  - Owners of capital receive interest on their investment
  - Examples: Factories, computers, vehicles

• Entrepreneurship:
  - Willingness and ability to take risks
  - Combines other three factors of production
  - Successful entrepreneurs earn profit
  - Key role in innovation and business development'''

• A measure of value: It can compare the value of two goods, such as a table and a skirt. It is also able to put a value on labour.

• A store of value: It is able to keep its value and can be kept for a long time.

• A method for deferred payment: Money can allow for debts to be created. People can therefore pay for things without having money in the present, and can pay for it later.'''

• Spare capacity:
  - Working below full capacity allows quick response
  - Makes supply more elastic

• Availability of factors of production:
  - Some factors need time to increase (e.g., skilled labor)
  - Limited availability makes supply more inelastic

• Ease of market entry:
  - High start-up costs make supply more inelastic
  - Trade unions/professional associations can restrict entry

• Investment (I) is spending by businesses on capital goods, such as new equipment and buildings as well as working capital e.g. stocks and work in progress; it makes up about 15-20% of AD. Most investment is by the private sector (about 75%) but there is also investment by the government.

• Government spending (G) is spending by the government on providing goods and services, generally public and merit goods, both on wages and salaries of public sector workers and on investment goods like new roads and schools. This will change year on year as governments decides how much they spend. Transfer payments such as pensions and jobseekers' allowances aren't included in the figure as money is just transferred from one group to another.

• Income effect: As a rise in prices is not matched straight away by a rise in income, people have lower real incomes so can afford to buy less, leading to a contraction demand.

• Substitution effect: If prices in the UK rise, less foreigners will want to buy British exports and more UK residents will want to buy imported foreign goods because they are cheaper. The rise in imports and fall of exports will decrease net exports so AD will contract.

• Real balance effect: A rise in prices will mean that the amount people have saved up will no longer be worth as much and so will offer less security. As a result, they will want to save more and so reduce their spending, causing a contraction in AD.

• Interest rate effect: Rising prices mean firms have to pay their workers more and so there is higher demand for money. If supply stays the same, then the 'price of money' i.e. interest rates will rise because of this higher demand. Higher interest rates mean that more people will save and less will borrow and will also mean that businesses invest less, so AD will contract.'''

• The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) shows how much an increase in income affects consumption. For most people, MPC will be positive but less than 1 i.e. an increase in income increases spending but spending doesn't increase by as much as income.

• Poorer people tend to have a higher MPC as they are likely to spend much more of their increase in income whilst richer people are more likely to save it.

• Consumer confidence: If people are confident about the future and expect pay rises, they will continue or increase their spending. If they expect high levels of inflation, they will buy now as it will be at a cheaper price.

• Wealth effects: People with greater wealth tend to have greater levels of consumption. The wealth effect is experienced when real house prices or share prices rise.

• Distribution of income: Those on high incomes tend to save a higher percentage of their income than those on low incomes.

• Tastes and attitudes: In our modern society, there is a strong materialistic drive that encourages people to have the newest and the best.'''

• Government influence and regulations: Governments can encourage investment through tax breaks or grants. Regulation can increase the cost and time taken to invest.

• Access to credit: Investment will be lower when an investment has a high risk attached to it.

• Retained profit: If firms are making higher retained profits, investment is likely to increase as they have money available to invest.

• Technological change: Improvements in technology will improve or speed up production which will increase the level of profitability.

• Even though basic wage rates have stayed the same, both the average and marginal cost of labour per good produced will rise - the business is paying more in wages for every good they produce.

• Therefore, the curve is upward sloping as firms are willing to supply more but only at a higher price.

• Changes in exchange rates: A weaker pound will lead to an increase in the price of imports and this will cause SRAS to decrease as production becomes more expensive.

• Changes in tax rates: Taxes increase the cost of production and thus they cause a fall in SRAS, shifting it to the left. Subsidies shift the curve right as they decrease costs.

• Low unemployment: Governments aim to have as near to full employment as possible. They account for frictional unemployment by aiming for an unemployment rate of around 3%. The labour force should also be employed in productive work.

• Low and stable inflation: In the UK, the government target is 2%, measured by CPI. This aims to provide price stability for firms and consumers and will help them make decisions for the long run. If the inflation rate falls 1% outside the target, the Governor of the Bank of England has to write a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

• Since less people are borrowing and more are saving, there is a fall in demand for assets such as stocks and bonds. This leads to a fall in prices for these assets, causing a negative wealth effect.

• People become less confident about borrowing and spending if interest rates rise. The fall in consumer and business confidence leads to a fall in consumption and investment.

• Higher rates will increase the incentive for foreigners to hold their money in British banks. This increases demand for pounds, making exports more expensive and imports cheaper, reducing net trade.'''

• Economic growth vs. Balance of Payments: Rapid growth can lead to balance of payments problems as seen in countries like India. When a country grows rapidly, imports tend to increase faster than exports, especially for consumer goods. In contrast, China's growth has been export-led, resulting in a trade surplus.

• Unemployment vs Inflation (Phillips Curve): There is often a trade-off between these objectives, as shown by the Phillips Curve. Lower unemployment tends to lead to higher inflation due to increased wage demands and spending. However, this relationship broke down during the 1970s stagflation when both high unemployment and high inflation occurred simultaneously.'''
